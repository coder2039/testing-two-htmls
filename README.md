# testing-two-htmls

I am learning HTML, CSS, Javascript.

I made two html files(index.html, english.html)

I wanted to add simple content for english.html and the content was successfully displayed.

But, I got this error message on console.

TypeError: null is not an object (evaluating 'contentOfEnglish.innerText =
'english.html content'')
global code@/script.js:4:17 at/script.js:4:17


How can I solve this error?? 

Thansk for your help in advance!
